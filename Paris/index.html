              <p>On our first day, we started by visiting <em>Montmartre</em> right away.<br>
                 Our second stop was the Eiffel Tower (check out that beautiful picture!) <br>
                 We ate dinner at a cute little bistro overlooking <em>la Seine</em>.</p>

            <p>On our second day, we went shopping on <em>Avenue des Champs Elysees</em>. <br>
              Every single person we saw was dressed in the height of fashion.<br>
              After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful places! We went to <em>Notre Dame</em>.<br>
              We went on a macaron tour of Paris and ate all of the best macarons the city had to offer. <br>
              After we finished shopping, we visited <em>le Louvre</em>.</p>

              <p>The picture below is of me visiting the <em>Arc de Triomphe</em>Arc de Triomphe. It's huge! <br>
                We also went to le <em>Musee D'Orsay</em>. Seeing the work of Renoir, Monet, and <br>
                Van Gogh in person was completely breathtaking. I was surprised to see <br>
                that the museum also had many sculptures including those by Auguste Rodin, <br>
                Paul Gauguin, and Alfred Barye.</p>
